Nomalization is an essential part of every machine learning project. It is used to bring all the features to the same scale. If the features are not normalized, the higher-valued features will outnumber the lower-valued ones.\n","\n","For example, suppose we have a dataset with two features: the number of bedrooms in a house and the size of the garden in square feet and we are trying to forecast the rent of the residence. If the features are not normalized, the feature with higher values will take precedence over the feature with lower values. In this scenario, the garden area has a greater value. As a result, the model will make an attempt to forecast the house's price depending on the size of the garden. As a consequence, the model will be faulty since most individuals will not pay higher rent for more garden area. We need to normalize the features in order to prevent this. Let's look at the following illustration to better comprehend what we have said:\n","* House 1: 2 bedrooms, 2500 sq. ft. garden\n","* House 2: 3 bedrooms, 500 sq. ft. garden\n","* House 3: 7 bedrooms, 2300 sq. ft. garden\n","\n","Considering that most people won't pay more for a larger garden, it follows that the rent for House 1 should be more comparable to House 2 than to House 3. However, if we give the aforementioned data to a k-NN classifier without normalization, it will compute the euclidean distance between the test and training examples and pick the class of the test instance based on the class of the closest training instance.\n","\n","The euclidean distance between the test instance and the training instances will be:\n","\n","* Distance between house 1 and house 2: $\\sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (2500-500)^2} = 2000$\n","* Distance between house 1 and house 3: $\\sqrt{(2-7)^2 + (2500-2300)^2} = 200$\n","\n","As you can see, the distance between houses 1 and 3 is shorter than that between houses 1 and 2. As a result, the model will forecast that house 1 will cost around the same as house 3. This is not what was anticipated. We need to normalize the features in order to prevent this. To normalize the features, subtract the minimum value of each feature from all the values of that feature and divide the result by the range of the feature. The range of a feature is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of that feature. The formula for normalization is given below:\n","\n","$$x_{normalized} = \\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}$$\n","\n","<html>\n","<center> \n","where, $x$ is the feature vector. The above formula will normalize the features to a scale of 0 to 1.\n","</center>\n","</html>\n","\n","\n","\n","Let's normalize the features in the above example. To do so, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of each feature. The minimum and maximum values of the number of bedrooms are 2 and 7, respectively. The minimum and maximum values of the garden area are 500 and 2500, respectively. The normalized values of the features are given below:\n","\n","* House 1: $(2 - 2) / 5 = 0$ bedrooms, $(2500 - 500) / 2000 = 0.75$ sq. ft. garden\n","* House 2: $(3 - 2) / 5 = 0.2$ bedrooms, $(500 - 500) / 2000 = 0$ sq. ft. garden\n","* House 3: $(7 - 2) / 5 = 1$ bedrooms, $(2300 - 500) / 2000 = 0.85$ sq. ft. garden\n","\n","Now, the euclidean distance between the test instance and the training instances will be:\n","\n","* Distance between house 1 and house 2: $\\sqrt{(0-0.2)^2 + (0.75-0)^2} = 0.77$\n","* Distance between house 1 and house 3: $\\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + (0.75-0.9)^2} = 1.11$\n","\n","As you can see now, the distance between houses 1 and 2 is shorter than that between houses 1 and 3. The model will thus forecast that house 1 will cost about the same as house 2, according to the prediction. This is what is anticipated. This is what normalization does. It equalizes the scale of all features. This is important because it prevents the features with higher values from dominating the features with lower values.\n","\n","Use the minimum and maximum values you found in the previous step to normalize the training and test sets.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KTdEBT_Jsc9o"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# write your code here\n","\n","min_train = np.min(train_set, axis=0)\n","max_train = np.max(train_set, axis=0)\n","\n","X_train_norm = (train_set - min_train) / (max_train - min_train)\n","\n","X_test_norm = (train_set - min_train) / (max_train - min_train)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"d8NmhrprtWy1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681668122185,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Adiba Haque","userId":"02582555920505249516"}}},"execution_count":67,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### **Step 9:**  Now, you have to build a classifier to classify the type of wheat seed based on the measurements of the seed.
